# tumor-detection
This project is part of M.Sc. Artificial Intelligence. The scope of the current project is with use of computer vision create machine learning models to detect tumor in MRI brain images. 

The dataset extracted from kaggle website. https://www.kaggle.com/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection

The two approaches for the implementation of neural networks were either custom Convolutional layers, either pretrained Convolutional layers.
